After carefully analysing all resume attributes these are the possible reccomendations i sugesst:

2.  Race and Gender has nothing to do with the callbacks, however Females with some sort of computer or special skills stand a high chance than their male counterparts
3.  The overall quality of the resume also impacts higer callbacks. For examples, resumes with professional emails, properly arranged resumes and resumes with the right font and style
